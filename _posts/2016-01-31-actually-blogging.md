title: Actually blogging - looking ahead
---

It's almost decided, I will be going to [KAUST](http://kaust.edu.sa) for a masters in CS. Not quite sure what research will I be doing but I'm hoping it will be exciting. I imagine that the masters will take about three semester or two semesters and a summer. But I have goals, yay:

1. Finish masters on time.
2. Do fun research/work on the side.
3. Investigate potential for interesting work that could be done in Saudi, I would ideally prefer to contribute to the country but that's very contingent on whether there is a meaningful enough way to do so. I don't want to look too far ahead in the future but if you (or someone you know) are doing something interesting there, then please let me know :D

In order to achieve goal 3, it appears that increased online presence is essential especially through Twitter. I spent the last two days reading about the reasons people follow Twitter accounts and it seems that I have to build a persona that's cool, informative, and "human". Not that I know what any of that means but I will be aggressive on that front and hopefully get to know a few people through the process. Maybe that will eventually incentivize me to do more blogging as well.

I don't understand the whole genre of sharing, but I'm working on it. Should make me more "human".
